"""Camera stream + control server for the Raspberry Pi (SCOPIO).

WHY THIS EXISTS
---------------
picamera2/libcamera ship from Raspberry Pi OS, NOT Ubuntu, so the camera cannot
live inside the Ubuntu ROS container. It lives here instead -- the SINGLE OWNER
of the sensor -- and everything else consumes it over loopback HTTP:

  GET  /stream.mjpg   -> live MJPEG video
  GET  /controls      -> current camera settings (incl. live exposure/gain)
  POST /controls      -> set framerate/exposure/gain/colour/contrast/... (JSON)
  POST /white_balance -> one-shot auto white balance; locks the measured gains
  GET  /focus         -> a focus metric (JPEG size)

Consumers (both on 127.0.0.1 -- this server is deliberately loopback-only):
  * the API gateway (scopio_gateway) proxies /stream.mjpg and the controls to
    authenticated external clients;
  * camera_node (ROS) ingests the stream in BRIDGE mode and republishes it on
    image/compressed + forwards the camera services here.

HOW IT RUNS (pick one; identical HTTP surface either way):
  * as the `camera` service in ros2_ws/docker-compose.yml (default -- comes up
    with the rest of the backend automatically), or
  * as a systemd unit on the Pi host if libcamera misbehaves in-container:
        camera_server/install_systemd.sh

Env: CAM_HOST (127.0.0.1), CAM_PORT (8081), CAM_W (640), CAM_H (480).
Requires: python3-picamera2 (Raspberry Pi OS Bookworm / the RPi apt archive).
